## Description<a name="description"></a>

My challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I'll also write unit tests for each part of the code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality and all of the tests passing. I also need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of my project.
